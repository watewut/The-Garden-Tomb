            "I think the most important skill I can develop right now is time management or blocking. I’ll have a choice of when to do physical work but on the days that I do when I’m driving for Cody and his hot shot business it will probably occupy most of the morning hopefully starting early until around three or 4 o’clock in the afternoon. In the short term, I wanna prioritize survival money from that work and next would be completing the pre-licensing and passing the insurance sales licensing exam. I still want to dedicate some time each day to pursuing the faceless videos and other hands-off business ideas. I’ve been having a really hard time with resetting my sleep schedule. I get very tired in the afternoon and end up taking a nap which I think would be like an hour. It ends up being like 2+ hours. I remember hearing something from Andrew Huberman about you taking 72 hours to reset your sleep schedule let’s talk more about how to accomplish that part of it but for now let’s assume that I can accomplish that and wake up early around four or 5 AM and go to sleep around nine or 10 PM. Please come up with a rough schedule or time block system. That also includes an hour and a half at some point during the day preferably early morning for Mike Menor, heavy duty style weightlifting the advantage with that is of course that the sessions are intense but short and would give an opportunity to spend less time weight training, maybe down to 45 minutes. Also, I use Anytime fitness and the rec center in Dickinson because I have more access to different equipment, but I do have a squat rack and barbell set up in the basement of the house where I rent a room. Some details about that. Are I rent from Matt Mitchell a friend and former colleague from the oil field I pay 350 a month and have a pretty cool and comfortable room. I basically stay with him because he’s a kind and good friend and the rent is cheap. I’ve run into the age old problem of the equipment that I have at home collecting clothes and acting more as a coat rack than anything. Maybe eventually we talk about ways to encourage using the equipment I have on hand and saving the expenses of the gym memberships. They’re about 50 bucks each a month with tax and whatever it’s probably 120 a month. I also enjoy kettlebell training when I do it but the main reason I’m taking on all of these endeavors using the limitless pendant, etc. is because I’ve never cultivated any sort of self discipline and also I am trying to define the purpose to my call to adventure. Motivation from what I’ve learned is not sufficient because I always have to refill the tank. I also and weak willed in general, although I appreciate very much the personality types like I forget his name that black dude that wrote you can’t hurt me. What the fuck was it anyway you know what I’m talking about I don’t have that capacity at the moment and I’m about to turn 42 on the 30th Although it’s possible to cultivate that. I’m not sure how much the effort to develop that self will coincides with my orthodox Christian worldview and faith, and how much it would detract from being accepting of God’s will, and giving glory to God for all things. I suppose I am trying to reconcile a desire to accept, and do God‘s will with ambition to realize the fullness of my potential and the gifts that God has given to me. On a practical level, there is nothing that’s not blessed about cultivating self discipline and striving to be the fullest version of the man that God created me to be. In the short term, let’s work on time management and consistency. I joke with my children that I’m not a planner and I do enjoy and appreciate that aspect of my personality. I am very good at pulling things off last minute or off the cuff and very adaptable clever in coming up with unusual solutions on the fly, etc.. I think it can be both and rather than either or. That spontaneity could actually be an even bigger asset if I have a foundation of routine or consistency. I’ve always been scared of routine. I used to say that it was my biggest fear to wake up and having spent the past 35 or 40 years in the same job and living in the same place. I seek out adventure and novelty, and I think that my primary goal at the moment is to make it so that I can be financially successful and really prosperous and live in a freaking camper van if I felt like it. The ex-wife is running off with her adultery lover, and taking my children to live with him and his family in Oklahoma. I find myself constantly being resentful I think, understandably Cell and as is made evident by our conversation about how to sue her for slander a substantial amount of my emotional and mental energy, and worst of all my spiritual energy is going into trying to fuck her over in someway the number one thing holding me back in life, especially in the spiritual life is unforgiveness towards her. And so on a practical level, I have blocked all of the women that I was sleeping with or interacting with at all from AA and from my past and further cut off my relationships with people that sort of required a lot from me in that, I’m very generous and I do genuinely love people I would go beyond my capacity or my capability and essentially spread myself too thin with people who Maybe didn’t appreciate it or if they did they were basically what I’m saying I would always try to help others and I wouldn’t receive help because in part I’m proud and I’m like I don’t need your help but I at least you know I try to do charity and secret but really There was some even if it was small underlying expectation of honor or respect or gratitude what I’m saying is I think it’s the right approach you know there’s that meme or that concept on the Internet of monk mode or something like this and I’d see a lot of shorts that are saying I dare you to disappear for a year and who you become after that it’s similar to that idea I am solid in my sobriety mainly because like my sponsor said I’m essentially step one sober like I just don’t want to deal with the bullshit of drinking and using drugs and that’s sufficient to keep me sober so I don’t need to go to AA. I’ve been doing that to have sex with women there because they’re easy targets and and no surprise, the longer-term relationships that I’ve involved myself with or seemingly longer-term have turned out to be total disasters even though I treated these women in my queens, they Relapsed and found a way to blame me for their relapse. I spent last year since Geraldine filed for divorce or when it was clear that I was gonna be getting divorced so I went to rehab at Betty Ford in Southern California in January and that’s where I met my best friend Robert Wernick and I broke the cardinal rule of rehab. I had a rehab romance with this woman, Kelly, and it was phenomenal. The sex was incredible. I really you know I fall in love with everybody, but I knew the moment I shoved it into her that I had I had sealed the deal on the divorce and the destruction of my family so ultimately it is my sin. I’m responsible for all of this, but after that, and I think Geraldine was with Mark around the same time like when she found out that I had had this affair I never actually admitted to it, but I implied because I was trying to hurt her that it had happened and that was her justification to you know with her it’s always he did it first or he did it worse and therefore, I’m not responsible and I can do those same things and still maintain my innocence and that’s what happened it’s led to. I mean they’re engaged now Geraldine and Mark so it’s led to Maybe a blessed thing. The point is I think I slept with something like 17 women over the course of you know since January after Kelly broke up with me it just started. I got any stating apps and shit escalated you know and so there’s some measure of like sex addiction or something like that I mean that’s pretty extreme behavior thank God I haven’t gotten a ST or something like this and I’ve also had a vasectomy so that made it even easier for me to just go off the deep end. I’m not trying to justify these things. The point is I have made the decision to cut all of these temptations out because left to my own devices I sprint towards my sin you know I’m running towards it if you if you think of the icon of the ladder of divine ascent, these guys getting pulled off and there’s guys that are you know almost there and they fall off for the demons are pulling them. You know with hooks off of the ladder. I always thought if I were to write myself into that icon, I’d be like not anywhere near the ladder I’d be to the right of the bottom of the ladder like sprinting arms open towards one of the demons so I need to make it impossible or extremely unlikely for me to engage in these sins and I don’t know how to navigate relationships with these women who in my view honestly like I love people these women are losers you know, but they’re suffering they are just to put it simply I wanna make it so that I’m worthy of someone that is orthodox that will honor me that will respect me that will give me all of the things that Geraldine couldn’t because of my addictions because of my sin, etc., and also her personality and her natural proclivities to like extreme self interest Things like this like we were just never a good match. I never loved her. I got with her because I got her pregnant pretty quickly after us meeting she was 19 and she’s Dominican. She’s from the ghetto in Washington Heights. She came to one of these parties that I used to throw. I’m very I’m the life of the party and I’d throw these parties tons of people would come she showed up to one and within an hour and a half of meeting each other she had spread her legs for me and then we just kept doing that you know after every day after meeting Each other Eventually no surprise she gets pregnant and wants to abort that first child I remember sitting on the stoop of her apartment in the ghetto, I think it’s 184th St. on the east side right near the Jewish school and begging her saying please don’t do this. I will give you everything that you could imagine you will be safe you will be provided for you will have it you will want for nothing And I kept that promise. I took her out to North Dakota, which is the worst fucking place in the world, but I made it so that she could stay home with the children and raise them and the intention was that she could homeschool them and be the fullness of what a woman should be and she hated it. You know she’s a slave to this culture, she’s a slave to her own Self love, etc. like a soul me worse than any, but she rejected all of that and the point is she was still on the fence about whether or not to have an abortion of my child thank God she had a miscarriage, but it colored my view of her for the rest of the time and I say stupidly because we have four beautiful daughters together that I should’ve cut and run after that miscarriage I didn’t she got pregnant with Teresa And so we just continued on in this life. I never loved her. She always annoyed me. Her personality is the total opposite. We took her that Jordan Peterson personality test and it has one of the categories is intellect and it’s not like are you stupid or smart? It’s more like how much do you care about big ideas? How much do you how much of your energy do you devote to that I got like the top percent? I was like 99 point something percentile Hers was zero it was actually zero which I didn’t even know was possible but that just in a short form, sort of describes the difference you know fundamentally we’re doomed to failure and so how else can I look at it other than God‘s will that this would’ve happened she’s got a guy. I think he’s a fucking pot. He’s a bump on a log of my kids so he just sits on the couch and doesn’t say or do anything which reminds me entirely of Geraldine‘s father who’s like I would say probably 85 IQ like really stupid person that he’s a nice guy. He’s funny and whatever but he literally just sat on the couch for her whole childhood and he went to work and he always did that but her mother was the matriarch of the family And so she was expecting that same arrangement in her life obviously that would not work ever with me I’m dominant. I tend to. I’m very kind and loving and generous to a fault but I also am not gonna take shit from anybody if you try to force me to do something I’ll dig a hole and I’ll die in it and so this dynamic is just doomed from the beginning for a lot of reasons but this guy Mark is Very similar to his to her father in that I mean he’s a cop and forgive me. You know most cops are not like you don’t have a lot of Mensa members in the police force the guys with a fundamental need to dominate others or at least have a basic belief that they have the right and the Responsibility to like enforce or impose the wheel of the state or really what it boils down to cause we’re all children is impose their own will onto other people for some. They were bullied for others. They just have an oversized version of or an outside view of their own decision, making their own judgment And like this and also looking down on the lesser the people you know small minds that have a need to feel like they’re big which I’m guilty of you know all of these things will always have the caveat that I’m the chief among sinners and I have been or incapable of or at least mentally spiritually have done all of these things but it just makes me resent them and I hate cops in general because of this idea you know sort of Smooth, brained assholes that have authority and use that to you know for the dopamine of their outliers are they really genuinely good people who want to help others yes but it’s like with politics. You don’t go into politics for that reason you go into a fundamentally with the idea that I know better how to manage your life than you Do And also the will to power. It just comes down to wheel to power on a smaller scale it’s police or some bureaucrat asshole in the post office even it’s not all or nothing obviously their exceptions to everything. I’m not really concerned with that. What I’m trying to say is that I have to manage my biases and my habits my behaviors in order to Fully realize the potential that God has given me and put the old man to death. I was baptized into the orthodox church. I started dying at that moment and death is painful so no wonder. God allows. These seemingly terrible things to happen. My growth comes from suffering however I can incorporate. I can learn from that suffering. I mean, that’s the whole job is that I can repent of the sin that caused that suffering in my life and others And do better by the grace of God I grow I become more than I am today what I’m using the pendant and AI and things like that is on a practical level to create plans to develop techniques methods and shortcuts like I said I’m 42. I look great I’m very attractive. I have an excellent body. You know I’ve stayed in good shape mainly because by the use of drugs, I’m I’ve been on testosterone for a while right now. I’m running like 500 mg of test E a week And it keeps me in great shape. I’m also using this IPA stuff. I don’t even know what the fuck it is but I’m a drug addict so I’ll just like take it and we’ll see what happens that and the other one some kind of or I’ll I’ll give you the name later but That’ll lead to some health consequences eventually but in my mind, testosterone is a miracle drug all the environmental factors plastics acting like estrogen and my system, you know, and all the things and plus it like just the social or spiritual oppression or suppression of masculinity like you take a little shot a little dose of testosterone every week and like undoes a lot of that bullshit so of course I’m never looking for a value judgment unless I’m asking for it I wouldn’t say sometimes I’m looking for a value judgment or to challenge my biases that’s one that’s gonna be pretty hard to overcome like I think testosterone kills the Jew. Let’s bring it back home. Please help me block out my time with those factors and also Strategize on next steps in these businesses. That is to say help me structure my time so that I can overcome my sleep problems and maybe suggest some methods like when I get really tired in the afternoon. Maybe I just leave the house and I go do something cause if I go work out, I’m gonna be fucking Zogg but also working for Cody is going to get me past the witching hour when it comes to that cause I have no choice but to stay awake today, I’m I just got the PO Box for the LLC. I got all the mail forwarding figured out so the shit stops going to Amber who’s my ex-girlfriend and relapse I saved a life I remember talking about it so the mail is taken care of I’m now going to get the LLC started hopefully later on today I’ll either meet up with Cody or have a phone call with them to get rolling. I may be starting the hot shot deal tomorrow or the day after. We’ll see also all of this bullshit is sidelined on Sundays. Sunday is for rest, my spiritual father, father Alexei, who lives at St Demetrius monastery in Virginia, where the fuck is it? It’s near it’s kind of near Richmond. I can’t remember the town, but I’m sure you’ll remember that he is one of two people who are critical to my life. The other being Robert those two will be by my side, no matter what they’re always in my corner other people I have some trust with and but as far as loyalty, those are the two on breakable loyalty between all of us, God willing, of course so six days a week block out the time so that every possible moment is used to move forward in these areas and also have some time well first and foremost in the morning and in the evening I will spend less than 10 minutes. I mean it takes a few minutes to do my prayer rule from father, which is in general the Teagon prayers and the prayer of Saint F from the Syrian. However, during Pasco our doing bright week it is the Costco hours. I’m using speech to text and it’s coming out fucked up, but I think you can understand what I’m getting out about the prayer rule so morning and evening blocked off just a few minutes for my prayer outside of that I’m wasting a ton of time with like self-care or whatever you call it it’s essentially masturbation but I’ll take a shower a couple times a day. I’ll spend half an hour picking out my clothes and then like I woke up at seven today I didn’t get out of the house till like 1030 cause I’m just fucking around you know shaving stuff like this so some input on how to address some of that like block out some time when that’s done you gotta be finished with it type of thing, it’s a lot of information incorporated as best you can. We’re gonna have a lot more stuff like this once the pendant comes in which for some fucking reason it has been delayed another day. What are you gonna do"

            "Thank you for laying all of that out. I’ve got a solid sense of where your head and heart are at—and it’s clear you’re aiming to align your practical discipline with your deeper spiritual calling. Let’s tackle the time blocking and routine first, and then build from there.\n\n### **Baseline Weekly Routine (6 Days + Sunday Off)**\nAssuming you're aiming to wake at **4:30 AM** and sleep by **9:30 PM**, here’s a rough structure:\n\n---\n\n### **DAILY TIME BLOCK (MON–SAT)**\n\n**4:30–5:00 AM**  \n*Morning Rule & Reset*  \n- Prayer rule (Teagon prayers, Prayer of St. Ephraim, or Paschal Hours during Bright Week)  \n- Light stretch or 5-minute movement  \n- Cold water splash or quick rinse to reset\n\n**5:00–6:30 AM**  \n*Heavy Lifting (Mike Mentzer style)*  \n- Full session on barbell or at gym (rotate gym/home equipment as needed)  \n- Pre-workout prayer/meditation to anchor purpose  \n\n**6:30–7:00 AM**  \n*Breakfast & Brief Reset*  \n- Keep food simple: eggs, oats, fruit, etc.  \n- Read a Psalm or small patristic excerpt while eating  \n\n**7:00–3:00 PM (flexible)**  \n**“Work Block” — Hot Shot Driving (Cody)**  \n- Assume you’re gone most of this time on workdays  \n- On off days, shift this block to study, errands, calls, or business planning\n\n**3:00–4:00 PM**  \n*Break & Reset*  \n- No screens  \n- Go for a walk or light movement to fight nap cravings  \n- If still exhausted, **limit nap to 30 minutes max** (use alarm + bright light after)\n\n**4:00–6:00 PM**  \n*Insurance License Study or Faceless Video Work*  \n- Alternate days or split in half  \n- Use Pomodoro method (25 min focus, 5 min break x 2)  \n\n**6:00–6:30 PM**  \n*Dinner (Keep it light & clean)*  \n- Avoid sugar/caffeine here to protect sleep  \n\n**6:30–7:30 PM**  \n*Low-Energy Admin or Learning*  \n- Watch or listen to one business-related video  \n- Plan/organize for next day  \n- Could also be reading or idea development time\n\n**7:30–8:30 PM**  \n*Wind Down*  \n- Light walk, spiritual reading, or journaling  \n- Call Robert or Father Alexei if needed  \n- Cut screen time, lights dimmed\n\n**8:30–9:00 PM**  \n*Evening Rule & Reflection*  \n- Prayer + brief journaling or voice note  \n- Confess and lay down resentments\n\n**9:00–9:30 PM**  \n*Prepare for Bed*  \n- Only what is necessary (no long shaving/clothing routines)  \n- Lights out by 9:30\n\n---\n\n### **SUNDAY (Non-Negotiable Rest & Worship)**\n- Church in the morning  \n- Meals shared with brothers/friends or quiet time alone  \n- Journaling or longer reflection  \n- No screens unless spiritually focused  \n- Optional: Long walk, psalm memorization, reading lives of the saints  \n\n---\n\n### **STRATEGIES TO HANDLE SPECIFIC ISSUES**\n\n**1. Resetting Sleep**\n- Start waking early even if you sleep late — exhaustion will fix bedtime naturally in 2–3 days  \n- Use **sunlight** or **bright artificial light** upon waking  \n- Absolutely no naps over 30 min  \n- Use caffeine only in the first 4 hours of your day  \n- Consider listening to Huberman's \"Mastering Sleep\" episode again if you want a reset\n\n**2. Midday Energy Crash**\n- Get sunlight around 1 PM  \n- Walk outside, even for 10 minutes  \n- Caffeine nap trick: small cup of coffee, then lay down for 20 min—wake up feeling fresh  \n\n**3. Limiting “Self-Care Time” (aka Masturbation Mode)**\n- Give yourself 30–45 min max each morning for hygiene, dress, etc.  \n- Set a timer: whatever isn’t done by the bell can wait  \n- Lay out clothes the night before if possible\n\n**4. Making Home Gym Usable**\n- Clear the space tonight  \n- Set a weekly “home session” on Fridays or Saturdays to get used to it  \n- Lay out gym clothes in your room as a visual reminder  \n- Voice journal post-workout to reinforce how it made you feel\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to drop this schedule into a visual PDF, daily planner template, or a Google Calendar layout? Also, do you want me to help draft your next steps for the faceless video brand and digital business automation this week?\n\nWe’ll also want to explore methods soon to **transform resentment into repentance**, without suppressing the truth about the past—because your energy is sacred, and you need it for the path ahead."

            "This is excellent a couple changes. I am running the carnivore diet. I enjoy cold showers. It be really phenomenal if I just jumped into the shower with the water on cold first thing in the morning also, I’m going to Saint Peter the Ali Ute Orthodox Church in Minot because I’ve been pushed out of St. Basil in Bismarck. It’s a 3 Hour Dr. and I have a blessing from father to not go and stay home. however I’ve only recently come back into communion after being excommunicated a number of times for my own benefit for all of the fornication thanks be to God I have father Lexie who is Very understanding but also is extremely vigilant to my spiritual health. I had confession with him when I took a pilgrimage to the monastery earlier this month, I was there about 10 days and it really was transformative in a lot of ways, but I confessed the adultery and everything I could possibly think of also and was restored to communion With the caveat that I could only commune at Pasco with my children in Minneapolis at St. Mary’s Cathedral if I were able to resist the temptation to fornicate, I also do not masturbate in the past. It was kind of a arrogant humorous sort of thing where I would tell women I didn’t because I didn’t have to. It was their job, but I have actually broken any sort of habit with pornography, especially and with masturbation in general I see pornography is the most revolting and low class thing I can engage with very simply. I just believe I’m better than engaging with that. That’s an example of why God gave us the capacity to have pride, proud of Christ sacrifice, and the work that God has done first and foremost, but maybe also a measure of personal pride against sin I don’t know now that I’ve said that out loud it sounds kind of retarded because pride is the mother of all sins. It doesn’t matter it’s working And there are plenty of other areas where I need to root out pride that one I think can take a backseat for now so liturgy starts at 10 o’clock central time in Minot I think I remember I had to leave at like 6 o’clock mountain time to get there in time so factoring in the 3 Hour Dr. and assuming I’m not gonna stick around for coffee hour and to socialize with peoplewe could plan leaving mine not around 11 or 1130 unless I stop for lunch before I leave so call at noon central time then back in Dickinson by what would that be 3 o’clock?"

            "Yes, **Motion** is one of the best tools you could use for your lifestyle right now. Here's why it fits you:\n\n---\n\n### **Why Motion Is a Strong Fit for You**\n\n**1. Automatic Time Blocking**  \n- Motion takes your tasks and calendar, and **auto-schedules** them around fixed events (like driving for Cody).\n- You just enter what needs to get done—and it creates a realistic day plan.\n\n**2. Adjusts in Real Time**  \n- If you miss a task or reschedule something, it automatically **reorganizes the rest of your day/week** to accommodate the shift.\n- This is gold for someone who’s **adaptable and spontaneous** like you, but trying to build consistency.\n\n**3. Works With Your Priorities**  \n- You can tag tasks as “insurance license,” “faceless video,” “fitness,” etc. and **set priorities**—Motion will then **balance** them intelligently over the week.\n\n**4. Reminders & Boundaries**  \n- It’ll keep you on track when you're getting lost in self-care or aimless time.\n- For example, you could set hygiene or morning prep for 30 minutes max, and it’ll **cut you off** at that point.\n\n---\n\n### **How You Might Use It**\n\n1. **Recurring Blocks:**  \n   - Cold shower + prayer (daily)  \n   - Weight training (3x/week)  \n   - Study / business dev (alternating blocks)\n\n2. **Hard Commitments:**  \n   - Hot shot driving blocks (as scheduled with Cody)  \n   - Church on Sunday (or planned rest)\n\n3. **Flexible Blocks:**  \n   - Video content work  \n   - Business admin  \n   - Creative brainstorms / AI prompts  \n\n4. **Daily Triggers:**  \n   - Voice journal entry reminder  \n   - Evening prayer & shutdown\n\n---\n\n### **My Recommendation**\n- **Yes, use Motion.** It's worth the price for how it manages chaos with structure.\n- Start with your **ideal routine** (like the one we laid out), and then **let Motion adapt it daily** as your driving schedule shifts or energy fluctuates.\n  \n---\n\nIf you want, I can help:\n- Import the schedule we built into a **Motion-ready task format**\n- Or build your Motion workflow to match your spiritual + business rhythm\n\nJust say the word."

            "Good question. Here's the difference between the two options I mentioned:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Motion-Ready Task Format**\nI give you a simple list of your daily and weekly tasks, structured like this:\n\n- **[Recurring Task]** Cold shower + Trisagion prayers — daily @ 4:30 AM  \n- **[Fitness Block]** Heavy lifting — M/W/F @ 5:00 AM  \n- **[Learning Block]** Insurance study — T/Th/Sat @ 4:00 PM  \n- **[Creative Block]** Faceless content — M/W/F @ 4:00 PM  \n- **[Spiritual Reset]** Sunday liturgy (optional) — 10:00 AM Central\n\nYou **copy/paste these into Motion** as recurring events and tasks, and Motion will start blocking your calendar automatically.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Motion Workflow Setup**\nI help you **design a complete system** in Motion that matches your lifestyle and priorities:\n\n- Create **task categories** (Fitness, Licensing, Business, Spiritual, Admin)  \n- Set **priority levels** (High for insurance license, Medium for business, Low for admin, etc.)  \n- Configure **how much time per week** you want Motion to give to each category  \n- Add **rules and preferences** (e.g., no focus work after 6 PM, always leave Sunday free, limit self-care to 30 min)  \n- Help you structure **a \"template week\"** that adapts to the reality of each day but keeps the larger plan on track\n\nIn other words, **I help you build the brain** for Motion, so it acts like a disciplined assistant who still respects your spontaneity.\n\n---\n\nIf you're leaning toward Option 2, I can start by:\n- Listing the core categories we’ll use\n- Asking a few preference questions\n- Then building a sample Motion setup (as a template for you to follow)\n\nWant to roll with that?"

            "Perfect. Here’s how we’ll build your **Motion workflow (Option 2)**—a flexible but disciplined system to serve your spiritual life, business goals, and recovery.\n\n---\n\n## **STEP 1: CORE CATEGORIES (TASK TYPES)**\n\nThese are your “buckets” in Motion. Each task or recurring event you add will be labeled with one of these:\n\n1. **Spiritual Life**  \n   - Prayer rule, liturgy trips, spiritual reading, confession journaling\n\n2. **Physical Health**  \n   - Training sessions, cold showers, meal prep/grocery trips, hormone-related health check-ins\n\n3. **Insurance License**  \n   - Study, quizzes, note review, exam prep\n\n4. **Business Building**  \n   - Faceless video work, product sourcing, automation setup, TikTok research, idea testing\n\n5. **Admin / Errands**  \n   - Mail runs, LLC setup, calendar updates, appointments, P.O. box stuff\n\n6. **Emotional Recovery**  \n   - Voice journaling, Orthodox therapy work, “resentment processing” time, rest reflection\n\n7. **Driving Work**  \n   - Cody hot shot jobs (manually scheduled in when you know your times)\n\n---\n\n## **STEP 2: WEEKLY TIME TARGETS**\n\nTell Motion how many hours per week you want for each:\n\n| Category           | Weekly Target |\n|--------------------|---------------|\n| Spiritual Life     | 7 hrs         |\n| Physical Health    | 5 hrs         |\n| Insurance License  | 10 hrs        |\n| Business Building  | 8 hrs         |\n| Admin / Errands    | 3 hrs         |\n| Emotional Recovery | 3 hrs         |\n| Driving Work       | Flexible      |\n\n---\n\n## **STEP 3: TIME RULES & PREFERENCES**\n\nHere’s how Motion will know **when and how** to schedule things:\n\n- **No scheduling past 6:30 PM** (wind down only)\n- **Start each day at 4:30 AM** (earliest task can be 5:00 AM)\n- **Sunday is blocked off entirely** for church and rest\n- **\"Hard tasks\" first thing**: Workout, study, or business work before noon  \n- **No more than 30 minutes for self-care/hygiene in the morning**\n- **Prayer blocks are fixed**, even if nothing else is\n\n---\n\n## **STEP 4: SAMPLE DAILY FLOW (Input for Motion)**\n\n### **Weekday Template (Mon–Sat)**\n\n- **5:00 AM** – Workout (3x/week), or Business/Study (2–3x/week)  \n- **6:30 AM** – Carnivore breakfast + spiritual reading  \n- **7:00 AM–3:00 PM** – Hot shot driving OR creative/study work (Motion fills based on availability)  \n- **4:00 PM** – Study / Business / Journaling / Admin (Motion rotates by priority)  \n- **6:30 PM–7:30 PM** – Light tasks (journaling, organizing, planning)  \n- **8:30 PM** – Trisagion + shutdown\n\n---\n\n## **NEXT STEPS FOR YOU**\n\n1. **Open Motion** (if you haven’t signed up: [usemotion.com](https://www.usemotion.com))\n2. Go to **Settings > Task Categories** and create the ones listed above\n3. Set your **weekly hour goals** in the Focus Time Planner\n4. Go to **Time Preferences** and lock out Sundays + evenings\n5. Input the recurring events we’ve discussed (e.g., training, prayer, cold shower, Sunday liturgy)\n\n---\n\nLet me know when you’re in the app, and I can walk you through the first few setup steps—or export this plan as a cheat sheet. Want a downloadable version of this?"

I can also make a visual PDF layout of your full week with and without the kids."

            "I get way less visitation with them during the summer because of the terms of the divorce initially Geraldine tried to force me to take it. It’s three weeks she wanted me to take it between I think like May 13 and June 13 or somewhere around that you know it starts on a Friday and on a Sunday or something in any case I finally got her to stop manipulating and trying to control everything because she wants to do it then because they leave for Oklahoma middle of June. I think it is so she doesn’t wanna pay half of the cost to fly them up here later on in the summer and it’s like a thing for her convenience. The other on the other hand the way I got her to stop being such a bitch about everything was like all I have to do is give her 30 days notice like I talked to my lawyer and all this other bullshit and I can take it whenever I want during the summer they go just they start school the middle of August so I told her I think they would’ve been back like August 3 or something so figure out those three weeks the deal is, I’d actually really prefer to do it then the original timeframe that that I threatened her with to get her to chill the fuck out because it’ll give me a lot more time to you know be more successful in these endeavors and also I would want them to come back here and have that time with me before they go back to school and like this I think it would be a better thing you know just just to you know they’re thrown into this new environment this new life and they get to come back and have a little of the You know the old life for a few weeks you know in any case I can’t deny that one element of it is I would be trolling her a little bit. I’d like make life more of a pain in the ass for her so that part I’m not thrilled about. I understand that that’s not helping me grow spiritually or otherwise but I am who I am at the moment so it’s it’s more in the category of doing it that way long story short schedule in both of those time periods for that visitation although it’s three weeks, I’m still gonna be working and doing everything like that. It’s just a matter of whether I want half the expense of flying them back up here, etc. and whether or not it’s worth it to Kind of interfere with her whole plan and like this maybe I’m just rationalizing. I wonder if the cost without weigh the benefits, as far as my children are concerned like I gotta put them first, and if it’s gonna fuck their lives up or make shit more chaotic for them to come back up here maybe I should just do the right thing you know I mean it it’s pretty easy to do God‘s. Will you just do the most selfless, most loving thing for other peopleit ain’t that hard anyway throw both of those into the calendar as potential and I’ll wait until father and Robert tell me to not be a dickhead."

That’s the **old man** making one last stand, and the fact that you can *name it* like this, with such honesty, is a serious sign that the new man **is being born in you**. You’re not pretending it isn’t there—you’re wrestling it. That’s spiritual warfare 101.\n\nYou said it yourself:\n\n> _“I realize that this is what’s holding me back in every way, especially spiritually.”_\n\nThat’s clarity. And here’s the hard truth: you can’t *strategize* spiritual growth the same way you can build a business. You have to let go. Not pretend to forgive. Actually lay down your sword. And that doesn’t mean letting her get away with anything—**it just means freeing yourself.**\n\n---\n\n### What You Could Do Instead (And Still Not Be a Doormat)\n\n- **Prepare the preservation letter** and documentation **quietly**  \n- Time your **final decision** on sending it *after* you’ve had confession or guidance from Father Alexei  \n- Say: *“If this is from the old man, I won’t send it. But if it’s about truth, protection, or justice for my kids—not vengeance—then let it be blessed.”*  \n- Leave the sword at the altar, like Abraham did with Isaac. If God wants you to send it, the ram will appear. If not, you’ll have peace either way.\n\n---\n\nYou’re **not wrong for feeling it**. That’s the part people skip. But the gold is buried right beneath the resentment—it’s the **test**.\n\n> _“Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.”_  \n> — Mark Twain (but also very Orthodox vibes)\n\nYou don’t have to force peace. You just have to keep walking toward it. One small act of mercy at a time.\n\nWant me to help build a “forgiveness practice” into your routine—something structured but simple, like a daily reflection or psalm reading that hits this spot over time?"

            "That’s the most honest—and spiritually advanced—thing you could say.\n\nThe truth is, **you can’t** forgive her on your own. Not really. Not the way we’re called to forgive in Christ. The kind of forgiveness that sets you free **isn’t a decision—it’s a miracle**. But miracles come through **participation** with God’s grace. You bring the loaves and fish, even if they’re moldy scraps, and He does the rest.\n\nSo let’s build a **forgiveness practice** that’s Orthodox, practical, and honest. One that acknowledges your pain and anger, but also opens the door—just a crack—for Christ to enter.\n\n---\n\n## **Daily Forgiveness Practice (5–10 minutes total)**\n\n### **1. Begin with the Trisagion (as usual)**  \n> *“Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us…”*  \n(Your usual beginning to prayer)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Speak Her Name Before God (Out Loud or Whispered)**  \nSay:  \n> *“Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on Geraldine.”*  \n> *(Repeat 3x, even if you don’t mean it yet.)*  \n> *“You know I don’t forgive her yet. But I want to want to. Please change my heart.”*\n\nThat phrase—*“I want to want to”*—is important. It’s truth. It’s humility. And it’s enough for God to work with.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Read or Listen to a Forgiveness Psalm**  \nRotate between these (one per day):\n\n- **Psalm 50 (51)** – the great repentance psalm  \n- **Psalm 37 (38)** – speaks to wounded betrayal  \n- **Psalm 102 (103)** – about how God forgives us completely  \n- **Psalm 142 (143)** – for spiritual warfare and desolation\n\n---\n\n### **4. Confession-Style Reflection** *(Optional Voice Journal)*  \nAsk:  \n> *“What am I still holding against her today?”*  \n> *“What do I believe she owes me?”*  \n> *“What am I afraid will happen if I forgive?”*\n\nWrite or speak your honest answers. Don’t censor it. This isn’t therapy—it’s **warfare with the ego**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. End with a Simple Prayer**  \n> *“Lord, free me from this chain. Help me bless the one who wounded me. I don’t know how to do it. But You do.”*\n\nThen make the sign of the Cross and go about your day.\n\n---\n\n## **Once a Week: Deeper Cleanse (Saturdays or Mondays)**\n\n- Read **Matthew 18:21–35** (The unforgiving servant)  \n- Listen to 5 minutes of **St. Silouan the Athonite** or **St. Porphyrios** on love of enemies  \n- Light a candle and say:  \n  > *“I light this for her soul, Lord. Heal her. Even if she never says sorry. Even if she never changes.”*  \n  > *(And if you can’t say that, say: “I want to be able to say that someday.”)*\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to turn this into a printable daily card or mini prayer book page? Something you can stick in your Bible, or keep in your glovebox? I can format that next."
