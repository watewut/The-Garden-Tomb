However, North Dakota would still need to agree to transfer the case.  \n3. **Filing Process** – Typically, you would file in **North Dakota** unless Oklahoma has become the children’s home state and North Dakota agrees to transfer jurisdiction.  \n\nIf your ex-wife recently moved the children, North Dakota is likely still the proper place to file. However, if they’ve been in Oklahoma for over six months, you might need to request a transfer of jurisdiction or file there.  \n\nA **family law attorney** in either state can help determine the right approach.

            "If your ex-wife hasn’t moved yet, filing **before** the move may be in your best interest. Here’s why:  \n\n1. **North Dakota Clearly Retains Jurisdiction** – Since the children still live in North Dakota, the court that issued the original custody order will have full authority over the case. If you wait until after the move, Oklahoma could become involved in jurisdiction disputes after six months.  \n2. **Preventing Relocation Without Court Approval** – If you believe the move is not in the children’s best interests, you could file a motion to modify custody and ask the court to prevent the relocation until custody is reviewed.  \n3. **Stronger Position for Modification** – Filing in North Dakota while still residing there may give you a stronger case, showing the court that your goal is to maintain stability for the children rather than simply following them to a new state.  \n\nIf you move to Oklahoma first, North Dakota still retains jurisdiction for a while, but you may weaken your argument if your ex-wife has already settled there with the kids.  \n\n### Suggested Next Steps:  \n- **Consult a family law attorney in North Dakota ASAP** to explore filing a **motion to modify custody** before the move.  \n- **Consider requesting a temporary order** to prevent the move until custody is resolved.  \n\nDo you want help finding legal resources in North Dakota?"

            "Yes, the fact that your divorce agreement **explicitly allowed for the move** in exchange for reduced child support could significantly impact how the court views your request for modification. Courts generally uphold agreements unless there is a **substantial change in circumstances** that was **unforeseen at the time of the agreement** and affects the children’s best interests.  \n\nHere’s how this might be considered:  \n\n1. **Agreement as a Binding Factor** – Since you agreed to the move as part of your divorce settlement, the court may see this as an informed decision. If you now want to modify custody based on that same move, the judge might question whether this is a form of **\"buyer’s remorse.\"**  \n2. **Change in Circumstances Argument** – If you can prove that the move is having **unexpected negative effects on the children** (e.g., worse schooling, instability, or a significant breakdown in your parent-child relationship), the court may consider modifying custody. However, simply regretting the agreement is **not enough** on its own.  \n3. **Your Move to Oklahoma** – If your primary argument is that you have now moved to Oklahoma and want a more equal parenting arrangement, the court may see this as a **predictable event** rather than an unforeseen change. However, if the children are struggling in Oklahoma or your ex is restricting your access despite your relocation, that could strengthen your case.  \n4. **Best Interests of the Child** – Ultimately, courts prioritize what benefits the children, not the parents. If your case is seen as a **parental dispute** rather than a child welfare issue, a judge may be less likely to modify custody.  \n\n### What You Can Do:  \n- **Gather Evidence of Any Negative Impact on the Children** – If the move is not going well for them, document it.  \n- **Demonstrate Your Continued Involvement** – Show that your move was to maintain a strong parental role, not just for convenience.  \n- **Consult a Family Law Attorney in North Dakota** – They can help craft an argument that focuses on the children’s well-being rather than just a change in your circumstances.  \n\nWould you like help finding legal guidance on this?"
